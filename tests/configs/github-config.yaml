traversal:

  ignored: []

# Verification parameters.
verification:
  # On 'anchor not found' error, how much similar anchors should be displayed as
  # hint. Number should be between 0 and 1, larger value means stricter filter.

  # declaring "Response timeout".

  # When a verification result is a "429 Too Many Requests" response
