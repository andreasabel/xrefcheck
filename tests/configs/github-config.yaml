  # How many attempts to retry an external link after getting

  # Timeouts may also be accounted here, see the description
  # of `maxTimeoutRetries` field.

  # If a site once responded with 429 error code, subsequent
  # request timeouts will also be treated as hitting the site's
  # rate limiter and result in retry attempts, unless the
  # maximum retries number has been reached.

  # On other errors xrefcheck fails immediately, without retrying.
  maxRetries: 3

# Querying a given domain that ever returned 429 before,
# this defines how many timeouts are allowed during retries.
#
# For such domains, timeouts likely mean hitting the rate limiter,
# and so xrefcheck considers timeouts in the same way as 429 errors.
#
# For other domains, a timeout results in a respective error, no retry
# attempts will be performed. Use `externalRefCheckTimeout` option
# to increase the time after which timeout is declared.
#
# This option is similar to `maxRetries`, the difference is that
# this `maxTimeoutRetries` option limits only the number of retries
# caused by timeouts, and `maxRetries` limits the number of retries
# caused both by 429s and timeouts.
