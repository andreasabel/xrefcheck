     Anchor 'SomE-HEADr' is not present, did you mean:

         - another-header (header I) at src:10:1-16

     Ambiguous reference to anchor 'another-header'
       In file a.md
       It could refer to either:
         - another-header (header I) at src:10:1-16
         - Another-header (hand made) at src:12:3-27
       Use of ambiguous anchors is discouraged because the target
       can change silently while the document containing it evolves.
